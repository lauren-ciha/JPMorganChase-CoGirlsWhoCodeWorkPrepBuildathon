# JPMorganChase-CoGirlsWhoCodeWorkPrepBuildathon

We created a Figma prototype for a social network platform to support women during the COVID-19 pandemic - all in three hours.

[Sanaa Mock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanaa-mock-aa0815146/), Faith Christian, and I created this project as a part of the summer 2021 [Girls Who Code Work Prep](https://girlswhocode.com/news/girls-who-code-announces-new-work-prep-initiative-designed-to-give-college-aged-women-pathways-into-the-tech-industry) program with JPMorgan Chase & Co.

This was our first time designing a web UI and wireframe in Figma. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn with these ladies!

Shout out to all the UI/UX designers out there --- easy-to-use interfaces are not easy to make!
